(R) DBMS vs DB: a database is simply a collection of organized data, while a database management system (DBMS) is the tool that handles and interacts with the data.
<> is the same as !=
Full join is used to verify the datas integrety

 * Concurrency problems:

* Lost Updates
* Dirty Reads
* Non-Repeating Reads
* Phantom Reads

 * Isolation levels and concurrency problems:
(YES = problem may occur, NO = problem is prevented)

| Isolation Level  | Lost Updates | Dirty Reads | Non-Repeating Reads | Phantom Reads |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| READ UNCOMMITTED | YES          | YES         | YES                 | YES           |
| READ COMMITTED   | YES          | NO          | YES                 | YES           |
| REPEATABLE READ  | NO           | NO          | NO                  | YES           |
| SERIALIZABLE     | NO           | NO          | NO                  | NO            |

 * Checking current isolation level (MySQL):

SESSION:
SELECT @@SESSION.transaction_isolation;

GLOBAL:
SELECT @@GLOBAL.transaction_isolation;

 * Changing isolation levels:

 * Change SESSION isolation level (current connection only):
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

 * Change GLOBAL isolation level (new connections only):
SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

 * Final required GLOBAL isolation level:

SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

 * When to use SESSION isolation level:

Use it when only one session needs a different isolation level, for testing, or for critical operations without affecting other users.
